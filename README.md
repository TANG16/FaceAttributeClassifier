# FaceAttributeClassifier
This project implements an attributed classification using features from the VGG face recognizer and linear SVMs.

The face_attribute() script is used to extract the feature 
descriptors using the VGG face model. In order to run this
function you must install matconvnet and update the path 
within addpath (line 8) accordingly.
